Natural Selection Simulator

Description:
The Natural Selection Simulator is a tool designed to simulate the dynamics of natural selection in a controlled environment. By manipulating various settings, users can explore how different factors influence the survival and evolution of populations.

Features:

Customizable Settings: Users can adjust parameters such as fur color, speed, movement type, genetic distribution, and initial population size to observe their effects on evolutionary outcomes.

Predator-Prey Interaction: The simulation includes a predator-prey dynamic, where users can click on the balls to simulate predation events. The effectiveness of camouflage, determined by the visibility of different colored balls against the background, can be observed and tested.

Data Recording: The simulator records and presents data on the population's genetic composition at each generational step. This data, including the amount of each type of allele, can be exported to a CSV file for further analysis.

How to Use:

Adjust the desired settings at the beginning of the program.
Observe the interaction between predators and prey, noting the effects of camouflage.
Record and export the data to analyze the evolutionary trends over multiple generations.

Usage Examples:

Explore how different levels of genetic diversity affect population resilience.
Investigate the impact of camouflage on survival rates in different environments.
Analyze evolutionary trends under varying selection pressures.
